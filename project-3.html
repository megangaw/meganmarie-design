      <p><b>Isometric Drawing:</b> An isometric drawing looks like an isometric projection but all its lines parallel to the three major axes are measurable. <br>
      Using only lines parallel to these three major lines I was able to create this design. I based the design on the different levels of my life. The top level being my country side and the second being my newly found city life.</p>
